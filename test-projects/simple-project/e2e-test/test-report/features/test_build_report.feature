Feature: test build report

  As a QA Engineer
  I want to inspect my automation build report

  Scenario: download drivers
    When  I open the file "~/Projects/AutoBDD/test-projects/simple-project/e2e-report/build-test/index.html"
    Then  I expect that the page title does equal the text "Multiple Cucumber HTML Reporter"
    And   I expect that the 1st element "table.tile_info" does match the regex "Passed[\s]+100.00 %[\s]+Failed[\s]+0.00 %"
    And   I expect that the 2nd element "table.tile_info" does match the regex "Passed[\s]+100.00 %[\s]+Failed[\s]+0.00 %"
